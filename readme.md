Below I will show some examples of code from this project.

## Technologies Used

## Examples

CSS:
This is an example of how to use the hover attribute in order to make an element fade in and fade out

        /*Navigation bar below header where my name is, used transition attribute to fade the navigation bar in and out*/

        .navv {
            padding: 15px;
            background-color: #EDE0D4;
            transition: opacity 0.5s ease;
            opacity: 60%;
            text-align: center;
        }


        /*When the mouse moves or hovers over these elements it will fade the color back in, when the mouse moves off it'll fade back out*/

        .navv:hover,
        .about:hover,
        .work:hover {
            background-color: #EDE0D4;
            opacity: 90%;
        }
